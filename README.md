A collection of hands-on DevOps and Kubernetes projects focused on real-world architecture, automation, observability, and security in cloud-native environments.

This collection represents my ongoing work in building **automated, secure, and observable Kubernetes infrastructures** that integrate DevOps best practices and cloud-native principles.

Each project is built as a reusable and modular blueprint that can be adapted for real production use.
